## Introduction

The Real-time Sensor Data Visualization on ThingsBoard project focuses on connecting sensors to the web and displaying real-time data in a user-friendly manner. It uses the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol to transmit data to the ThingsBoard platform, which is a powerful IoT platform that enables efficient data collection, visualization, and analysis.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Visualization:** Display sensor data in real-time on a web page.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Create interactive dashboards for data visualization.
- **Customizable:** Tailor the web page to your design and data visualization preferences.
- **IoT Compatibility:** Easily connect IoT sensors to the platform.
- **Scalable:** Expand your setup to accommodate multiple sensors and devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the Real-time Sensor Data Visualization project, make sure you have the following components in place:

- IoT sensors or devices capable of sending data.
- A ThingsBoard account or instance for data collection and visualization.

### Configuring ThingsBoard

1. Create a ThingsBoard account or set up your ThingsBoard instance.

2. Create a device in ThingsBoard for your sensor. Make note of the device access token.

3. Configure your sensor or device to send data via the MQTT protocol to the ThingsBoard platform using the device access token.

### Sending Data via MQTT

1. Ensure your sensor or device is set up to send data using the MQTT protocol to your ThingsBoard instance.

2. Monitor your web page for incoming data using JavaScript and update the visualizations accordingly.

## Customization

You have the flexibility to customize the web page, including the layout, design, and data visualizations. Make the web page your own by tailoring it to your specific project requirements.

## Documentation and Resources
